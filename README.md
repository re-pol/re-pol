### // about me

A weird **Finnish** nerd whose interests keep changing before even I can blink.  
I started learning **programming in 2016**, and since then it's been kind of stuck in my life in some shape or form.  

A thing happened though, and for some reason, it sparked a weird revival of my enjoyment in actual programming.
