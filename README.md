<h3>// about me</h3>
<div>
<p>A weird <span>Finnish</span> nerd who's interests keep changing before even I can blink, I started learning <strong>Programming in 2016</strong> and after that's it's been kind of stuck in my life in some shape or form. A thing happened though, and for some reason it has sparked some sort of a weird revival of my enjoyment in actual programming.</p>

<h3>// projects</h3>
<div>
<ul>
    <li>FiveM Resources: Trying to create unique and well performing resources for frameworks such as QBox.</li>
    <li>RedM Resources: More like experiments with the new features and natives that are available in Red Dead Redemption 2.</li>
    <li>Personal Website: I've always been meaning to create my own website, so maybe now is the correct time for that.</li>
</ul>

<h3>// learning</h3>
<div>
<ul>
    <li>RDR2 ASI Mods: <span>Since working with RedM, I realized that since it uses the same natives, there's a lot of possibilties when it comes to possible mods for Red Dead Redemption 2.</span></li>
    <li>C++: <span>Slowly but surely... maybe not, i mean I just want to be not think about it, it hurts brain.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Operating System:</span> I started daily driving <span>Arch Linux</span> around late 2024. I still have to keep a Windows install on another drive as I need to play some games with Anti-Cheat because they are too dumb to finally allow for Linux users to enjoy them. Their loss.</p>
<p><span>Code Editor:</span> I use <span>nvim</span> on Arch and VS Code on Windows since it's just easier for me.</p>
