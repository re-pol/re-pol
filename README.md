<h3>// about me</h3>
<div>
<p>A weird <span>Finnish</span> nerd who's interests keep changing before even I can blink, I started learning <strong>Programming in 2016</strong> and after that's it's been kind of stuck in my life in some shape or form. A thing happened though, and for some reason it has sparked some sort of a weird revival of my enjoyment in actual programming.</p>
